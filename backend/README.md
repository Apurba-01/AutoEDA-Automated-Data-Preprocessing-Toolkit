## 3. Backend README (backend/README.md)


## Overview
The backend of AutoEDA is built with Python and Flask, handling data preprocessing and machine learning model integration. It provides a set of APIs for uploading datasets, performing preprocessing, and downloading the cleaned data.

## Building the Model
To build the machine learning model, you will need to implement various data cleaning, filtering, and processing functions. Ensure that your functions are modular and can be easily integrated into the existing workflow.

## Running the Backend
To run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
