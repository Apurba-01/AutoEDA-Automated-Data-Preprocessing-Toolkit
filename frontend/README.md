## Overview
The frontend of AutoEDA is built using React and Vite, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for users to upload datasets and manage preprocessing tasks. It communicates with the backend to retrieve processed data and offers a seamless experience.

## Workflow
1. **File Upload**: Users can upload their CSV files through a dedicated upload interface.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Once uploaded, the data is sent to the backend for preprocessing.
3. **Download Processed Data**: Users can download the cleaned and preprocessed dataset directly from the frontend.

## Running the Frontend
To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
